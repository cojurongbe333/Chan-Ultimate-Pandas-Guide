### 🧠 How to Use This Repository

1. Start with `01-foundations/`
    Learn the anatomy of pandas: what Series and DataFrames are, and how to explore them.

2. Move through each module in order
   Each folder includes a detailed `README.md` lesson with clear narrative and learning objectives. These are not summaries — they are full teaching units.

3. Practice with real projects
   
   Explore the `05-projects-and-challenges/` folder, or go directly into:
    - `datasets/projects/` to find CSVs
    - `notebooks/projects/` for templates
    - `solutions/notebooks/projects/` for completed walkthroughs

4. Tinker, break, and fix

   Pandas is best learned by doing. Modify the data, try new transformations, and compare your approaches to the solution notebooks.
